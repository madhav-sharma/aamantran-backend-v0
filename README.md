3. **Optional Fields**:
   - Prefix (Mr, Mrs, etc.)
   - Greeting Name (free-form text, max 60 characters)
   - Phone (for non-primary contacts)

### Phone Number Formats

The system accepts international formats:

- **India**: +91 (10 digits) â†’ +91-XXXXX-XXXXX
- **UAE**: +971 (9 digits) â†’ +971-XX-XXX-XXXX
- **Others**: Any valid E.164 format (8-15 digits)

### Managing Guests

- **Ready Status**: Check the checkbox to mark guests for invitation
  - Disabled for guests without phone numbers
  - Auto-saves on change
- **Group Organization**: Guests are sorted by group, with primaries first
- **Phone Colors**: Different countries shown with different background colors
  - ðŸŸ§ Orange: India (+91)
  - ðŸŸ¨ Light Yellow: UAE (+971)
  - ðŸŸ¦ Light Blue: US/Canada (+1)
  - ðŸŸ© Light Green: UK (+44)
  - â¬œ Light Gray: Other countries

### Sending Invitations

1. Mark guests as "Ready" using the checkbox
2. Click "Send Invites to Ready Guests" button

## API Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Main UI page |
| `/guests` | GET | Retrieve all guests |
| `/guests` | POST | Add a new guest |
| `/guests/{id}` | PATCH | Update ready status |
| `/send-invites` | POST | Send WhatsApp invitations |
| `/webhook` | GET/POST | WhatsApp webhook |

## Validation Rules

### Client-Side (Format)
- **Names**: Letters only, auto-capitalized
- **Greeting**: Any text, max 60 characters
- **Phone**: Valid E.164 format with country code
- **Group ID**: Lowercase letters only

### Server-Side (Business Logic)
- Phone numbers must be unique
- First member of a group must be primary
- Primary contacts must have phone numbers
- Guest data is immutable (except ready status)

## WhatsApp Webhook Setup

For local development with webhooks:

```bash
# Use ngrok or similar
ngrok http 8000

# Configure webhook URL in WhatsApp Business API
https://your-domain.ngrok.io/webhook
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Phone number already exists"**
   - Each phone number must be unique across all guests

2. **"First member of a group must be primary"**
   - Always add the primary contact before other group members

3. **"Primary guest must have a phone number"**
   - Primary contacts require phone numbers for group communication

4. **WhatsApp API errors**
   - Verify your `.env` configuration
   - Check API credentials and template name
   - Ensure phone numbers are in correct format

### Development Notes

- Database (`wedding.db`) is created automatically on first run
- Guest table refreshes every 30 seconds for webhook updates
- All timestamps are stored in UTC
- Phone numbers are stored in E.164 format without formatting
